            <h3>Externel Hosting</h3>
            <p>
                This website is hosted by an external service provider (hoster). The personal data collected on this
                website is stored on the hoster's servers. This may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses,
                contact requests, meta and communication data, contractual data, contact details, names, website
                accesses and other data generated via a website.

                (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO) and in the interest of a secure, fast and efficient provision of our
                online offer by a professional provider (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO). Insofar as a corresponding
                consent has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a
                DSGVO and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to
                information in the user's terminal device (e.g. device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG.
                The consent can be revoked at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our hoster will only process your data to the extent that this is necessary for the fulfilment of its
                service obligations and will follow our instructions with regard to this data.

            <h3>Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
                personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this
                data protection declaration.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data by which you can
                be personally identified. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it. It
                also explains how and for what purpose this is done.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail)
                can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

            <h3>Storage time</h3>
            <p>
                Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data
                will remain with us until the purpose for processing the data no longer applies. If you assert a
                justified request for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we
                have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax
                or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted after these reasons no longer apply.
            </p>
            <h3>
                General information on the legal basis of
                Data processing on this website
            </h3>
            <p>
                If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1
                lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO if special categories of data are processed according to
                Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third
                countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO. If you have
                consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your terminal device (e.g. via
                device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally carried out on the basis of &sect; 25 para.
                1
                TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a
                contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of
                Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfilment of a legal
                obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. Furthermore, the data processing
                may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
                Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs
                of this data protection declaration.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries
            </h3>
            <p>
                Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not
                secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to
                these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection
                comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged
                to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take
                legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. intelligence
                services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring
                purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.
            </p>
            <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
            <p>
                Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you
                have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation
                remains unaffected by the revocation.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Right to object to the collection of data in specific cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)
            </h3>
            <p>
                IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE
                PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS
                ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS
                BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR
                PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE
                YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR
                DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21(1) DSGVO).
            </p>
            <p>
                IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT
                ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO
                APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
                DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART.
                21 PARA. 2 DSGVO).
            </p>
            <h3>
                Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory
                authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the
                place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or
                judicial remedy.
            </p>
            <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
            <p>
                You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in
                performance of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format.
                If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as
                it is technically feasible.
            </p>
            <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
            <p>
                or security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or enquiries
                that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognise an
                encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to
                "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

            </p>
            <p>
                If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
            </p>
            <h3>Information, deletion and correction</h3>
            <p>
                Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
                information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the data
                processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any
                time with regard to this and any other questions you may have on the subject of personal data.
            </p>
            <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
            <p>
                You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do this, you
                can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to check this.
                    For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the
                    processing of your personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the
                    restriction of data processing instead of erasure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims,
                    you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of
                    erasure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests
                    must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
                    right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored -
                only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the
                protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public
                interest of the European Union or a Member State.

                If you send us enquiries via the contact form, your details from the enquiry form, including the contact
                details you provide there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the
                event of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO if your request is related to the
                performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all
                other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective handling of the
                enquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO)
                if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.
            </p>

                The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke
                your consent to store it or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after we have
                completed processing your enquiry). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods -
                remain unaffected.

                If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your enquiry including all personal data resulting from
                it (name, enquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do
                not pass on this data without your consent.
            </p>

                The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO if your request is related to the
                performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all
                other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of enquiries
                addressed to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO) if this has been
                requested; consent can be revoked at any time.

            <p>
                The data you send us via contact requests will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke
                your consent to store it or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request
                has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain
                unaffected.

            <h2>5. Newsletter</h2>
            <h3>Newsletter data</h3>
            <p>
                If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from
                you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address
                provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. Further data will not be collected or will only
                be collected on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information
                and do not pass it on to third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                The processing of the data entered in the newsletter registration form is based exclusively on your
                consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the
                e-mail address and their use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe"
                link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains
                unaffected by the revocation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data you provide us with for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the
                newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the
                newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the purpose has ceased
                to exist. We reserve the right to delete or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter distribution list
                at our own discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data that has been stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you have unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your email address will be stored by
                us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist if necessary to prevent future mailings. The data
                from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This
                serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters
                (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO). The storage in the blacklist is
                not limited in time.
                <strong>You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest. </strong>
